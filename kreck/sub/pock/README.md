Pock is a low level LISP-like ~~tarpit~~ language with some unusual features:
- It has only one value of atoms (a leaf)
- Like [Urbit](https://urbit.org/)'s hoon/nock it's [acyclic, subject-oriented and arguably even more homoiconic than LISP](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/overview#what-properties-does-hoon-have-what-type-of-language-is-it)
