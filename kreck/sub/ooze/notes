2 text areas
left acts as an editor
right is for displaying stuff



editor markup language?
	why?
		tree aware editing, wide cursors, stuff like that
	yay
	nay
		complicated
		may be clunky



;text approach

top level detection
	just have a table with positions of top level parentheses
	before inserting new parenthesis, check the cursor position and modify the table if needed

textarea doesn't track lines

line postitions change after each insertion

lazy lines?

;structured approach


zipper cursor

linebraks as elements
