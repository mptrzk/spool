improper lists with boxes are ambiguous
	nil would have to be a boxed nil, that is "(())" to avoid ambiguity

elaborate on pprint kerfuffle
noob mistake - listp instead of consp

pretty print
	n elements, then "..."
	using format language?
		nah, let's keep it more lispy than not
			even docs for simple stuff is a mess
	how
		printing each element returns indent
		lists
			data
				(foo
				 bar
				 baz)
			code
				(foo bar
				     baz)
		semi-auras
			stuff like indentation, nesting, length
			atoms are left to common lisp
			
			number of elements in first line, indent

parenthesised op indenting
((foo) bar
 			 baz)

modify aura-list?
	(list first-line indent aura1 auras)

interactive debug
	an exop that:
		according to options
			eval, eval-rec, eval-rec-skip <- bonus - write in kreck as a DSL
				displays subj and formula to be evaled
					subj optional?
		asks for input, which is
			eval
			eval-rec
			eval-rec-skip
			skip
		if eval
			a -> (d a)
			(a . b) -> ((d a) . b)
		if eval-rec
			a -> (d a "rec")
			(a . b) -> ((d a "rec") . b)
		if eval-rec-skip
			a -> (d a "rec-skip")
			(a . b) -> ((d a 1) . b) << continue


"defs" should be used cautiously when specifying inop's deflist
	 
rename *defs*
	there will be many different deflists

code should be as easy to write as possible using a given layer of "goodness"

gen 0 - recursion dependent on dynamic binding 
gen 1 - no dynamic binding
gen 2 - typesafe
gen ? - compiled

dyn-defs?




define-eval
how macrolet works?

skill roadblock
	I cannot design well stuff I'm not proficient with

type system
monads
hoonisms

"l" in (c l arg1)
	should closures be boxed?
		yay
			solves the above problem
				is it really a problem?
					shouldn't that "l" be necessarily quoted?
		nay
	just consider l as an arg


should code be always paired with a deflist?
	what? it is

explain evaluation in:
		(unparse (kreck '(1 2 3) '((* ($) (f-gate (c arg1 arg1))) 1)))
	def generation where getter would be

fex-gate


((* ($) (fex-gate (l arg1 (*^ (q arg1))))) (> arg1))
^^ why quote?
	nooo!
		arg1 was an atom

non-stupid recursion with name
	add (name . rec) to defs
		problem in nested functions
			wrong context

gates and deflist capturing

macrofy fexpr-gates

smarter "l" seems more dangerous when bootstrapping without expansion
	dumb "l" calls its own name only in branch
