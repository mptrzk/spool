simpler than lisp

the problem of implicit logic

throwaway languages
	changing gc is not changing language semantics
	writing a lisp interpreter and just using it instead would be such
compilation?


[move?]
is doing SnC in C sane?
	no macros
	no good checking facilities
	speed is not that important in the first interpreter

the island challenge
	why not asm
		The best way to do it would be to write in a higher level
			programming language and transcribe it to asm
		I'm preparing for an island
		I can use w

external parser - statically substituded defs, not symbols
internally parsed stuff works like externally parsed stuff, but is more powerful
	lets and stuff

"let" and quoting work differently in lisp due to interpreter not evaluating symbols dynamically
[is it phil, or more like distilled design stuff?]
it's really odd that I haven't realized it till now
