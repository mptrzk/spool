;UNDISTILLED

reorganization of "kreck" folder in kreck, or general org notes?

why not make all notes in one file?

misc in misc?

undistilled vs uncategorized


files happen when one category is so distinct it deserves it's own space

"problems of marrying to acyclic data structures"
	in kreck

"generic note files:"
	does it belong in "meta" or "org"?

"why folders for rewrites instead of git versions?"
	it belongs in index
	is it better to ask "folders or git versions"
		it's resolved for now
		maybe reframe it as a yay/nay

problem with "index"
	it sounds like it should contain just the index
	solution
		call it something else like "layout"
		put 
	does the master "todo" belong there?
		if so, the better name would be "org"

are all notes for organization?
	what is organization?
		where stuff is and what it means
	

usefulness of "DISTILLED" section
	does it mean "RESOLVED"?



[move]
pth
	programming theory
	shouldn't "pld" be in it?
		yay
		nay


[move]
merge typo into kreck?
	not important

should every note file describe itself?
	yay
	nay
		there are meta files

metanotes vs metaspool
	isn't metaspool just notes?
should meta files describe stuff other than notes
	yay
	nay
by metaspool I meant stuff that refers to "where stuff is" in the project
this can be called "organization"
this can be also called ""

"meta" notes are just notes about notes


isn't index just "tree" command?
	index is more for others or for me that forgot what file names mean
	it's for consistency

distilling notes
avoiding duplication

meta vs metaphil?
	meta is with respect to the entire project
	metaphil is about the philosophy
	metaphilosophy in philosophy file?
	"merge typo into kreck?"


pock & kreck have similar topics


a principled approach to exploratory notetaking
	what?
		notetaking intended to help exploring stuff
		semantic bloat?
			what?
	conflicting taxonomy problem
		  style & topic
		styles
			undistilled
				tag
				exploration
					plan
					dilemma
			distilled
				map
				prose
	other problems
		too many files
		orphaned files
			orphaned info in general
			old stuff ends up being in the way
				I like to keep it
				It has trailing relevance
				It takes time and effort to organize it
		duplicates
	I end up not reading notes after all
		There's no obvious way to start
		files create barriers
	when are files created
		topic differences
		writing near irrelevant stuff

styles in one file, topics in many

note problems are aesthetic problems
	aesthetic problems are dangerous

interleaving taxonomies
