	in language without proofs tests are mostly concerned with making sure that

	natural language descriptions before tests
	describe input and output
		in imperative languages - including state

bugs
	tests!!!
	learn from important bugs
		how did I make it?
		how did I find it?
	learn from bugs tha

big bugs
	that thread bug
	big ABC bug
		what?
		how I made it
			trying to be smart before figuring out how ABC really works
		how I found it
	big SnC bug
		calling gc in function that has "Cell" type arguments, which got corrupted
			also because of premature optimization?

small bugs that could've been big
	SnC defs bug
		similar to big SnC bug

just bugs
	ABC off by one
